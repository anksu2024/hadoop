For the description refer to the README file give on the link:

The new stuff in this is that a custom Caparator is implemented.
Purpose of this is, the Reducer gets the key value pairs in such
a manner such that the first key value pair corresponds to the
department table information.

This is done in order to avoid the 2 * O(n) traversals of values
Reducer receives.

Our purpose is not to make it algorithmically efficient but to
reduce the application execution time.
